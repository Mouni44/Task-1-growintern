       ---- ABOUT THE PROJECT : ----
              Designing a logo and branding materials for a fictional company using GIMP is an exciting creative project. 
        Let's create a fictional company and go through the process of designing a logo and accompanying branding materials step by step.

                                  Fictional Company: "EcoTech Solutions"

        Research the Target Audience and Company's Values:

            Eco-conscious consumers, businesses, and organizations interested in sustainable and environmentally friendly technology solutions.
        The company value's are sustainability, innovation, eco-friendliness, and cutting-edge technology.

        Design Choices Explained:

            The globe symbol ( According to me it says BULB ) represents EcoTech Solutions' global impact and commitment to 
        environmental solutions. The green and blue colors represent sustainability and eco-friendliness, while the circuit 
        board pattern within the globe signifies the technological aspect. The clean and modern font used in the logo and 
        branding materials conveys professionalism and innovation. The use of eco-friendly colors, clean design, and subtle 
        tech elements in business cards and letterheads maintains consistency with the company's values. Once you've designed 
        the logo, business cards, and letterhead, you can export the files for printing or digital use. This branding concept 
        aims to create a unique and memorable visual identity for "EcoTech Solutions" while staying true to the company's 
        values and target audience.
